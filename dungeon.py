# Written by Eirik VesterkjÃ¦r
# This is a basic dungeon layout generator.
# It supports dungeons of dimension > 5x5.
# Rooms are placed randomly, and the total area of rooms placed
# is determined by a density-parameter.
# Paths connect the rooms. The paths are drawn by separating
# diagonal lines them into two straight parts.
# To determine which paths to draw, I use a modified Prim's Algorithm.
# It creates a span tree which includes all rooms, but the weight of a new room
# is only determined by the distance between it and -any- room which
# has already been added to the span tree. So it is not a true MST.
